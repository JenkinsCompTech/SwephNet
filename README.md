SwephNet
===========

This project is an Astrodienst Swiss Ephemeris (http://www.astro.com/swisseph/) .Net version in a 
PCL project for cross platform usage.

It is a rewrite of the (https://github.com/ygrenier/SwissEphNet) project with the .Net guidelines, 
so it's an .Net optimization of the SwissEphNet project but with a different interface.

This project is currently under development, so you can't use it prefer 
(https://github.com/ygrenier/SwissEphNet) instead.
